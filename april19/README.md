## Assignment 8 (April 19)
### Connecting P5 and Arduino using p5.Serial

#### Description:
In Class Exercises

#### Exercise 1:
Problem Statement: Make something that uses only one sensor on arduino and makes the ellipse in p5 move on the horizontal axis, in the middle of the screen, and nothing on arduino is controlled by p5

#### Exercise 3:
Problem Statement: Take the [gravity wind example](https://editor.p5js.org/aaronsherwood/sketches/I7iQrNCul) and make it so every time the ball bounces one led lights up and then turns off, and you can control the wind from one analog sensor

In this, we have reduced the frame rate to better understand, and show when the blinking of the light occurs or goes off:

We added this in the loop function of p5 code: ````frameRate(10);````

#### Learning Experience:
- I loved working in a team as it is very a very efficient way of debugging.
- There are some parts which I perhaps needed more clarity on, and working in a team turned out to be the best way to clarify all the blocks.
