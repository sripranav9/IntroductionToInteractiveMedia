#### Challenges Faced:
1. I have estimated the canvas size incorrectly and now it is hard to change the canvas size alone as it changes its dimensions with respect to (0,0) co-ordinates. 
2. It was not possible for me to orient a rectangle in a different angle (for the hands of the T-shirt).
3. I tried to color between two lines but wasn't sure how that works.
