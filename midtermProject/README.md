# Mid-Term Project
## Introduction to Interactive Media | New York Univeristy Abu Dhabi

#### Journal:
I have documented my intital concept, complications, and solutions in a [journal](https://github.com/sripranav9/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/main/midtermProject/journal.md).

#### Intital Code to solve the complications:
- You can find the [intital code](https://github.com/sripranav9/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/main/midtermProject/testRun.js) I have done to ensure I have an efficient solution to the problem I was facing.
- Here are a few [videos](https://github.com/sripranav9/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/main/midtermProject/journal.md#code-implemention) of how the program runs.
