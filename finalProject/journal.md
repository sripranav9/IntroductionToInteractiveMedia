# Final Project Journal

Groups: Ayesha and Pranav

#### Date: 18th April 2022
### Preliminary Idea:
The idea is inspired from robot cleaners. Just for the background, we've watched quite a few videos on how they work and how we can put the tools of Arduino that we have to make something similar. What does the robot do? There is a cleaner, probably a motor with a brush, and the robot senses the obstacles and changes its course of direction to avoid hitting it. 

In our case, We know there is an Ultra-sonic sensor that can help us with the obstacles and we have wheels and motors to make the robot. The idea is not exactly to make a cleaner, but something similar which runs in parallel in terms of the sensors used in Robot Cleaner.
