## Unusual Switch
### Idea:
This is actually a very interesting assignment. When I went through the examples, and some other sources online, I've got so many ideas and I was excited to implement them practically. One that stood out was the idea where the bulb glows if I keep my cards (NYU ID Card and Room Card) back in their place, which is the first drawer near my study table. If only I had a way to tell if my cards were there in the drawer (in their usual place)! Well now it looks like I do. I want to make a circut which switches ON when the cards are in their place and OFF otherwise.

### Desciption:
The circuit will be placed on my table with a part of the circuit going into my drawer. The idea behind this is for me to know if the cards are in their place (in the drawer), which is even the light glows.
