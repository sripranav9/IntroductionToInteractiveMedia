## Assignment 5 (March 30)
### Unusual Switch


The bulb flickers when the cards (NYU ID and Room Card) are in place and does not flicker or glow when the cards are not in their place.


#### Idea:
I am very interested and excited to work on this assignment and find real world applications of the unusual switch. When I went through the examples, and some other sources online, I've got so many ideas and I was excited to implement all of them practically. One that stood out was the idea where the bulb glows if I keep my cards (NYU ID Card and Room Card) back in their place, which is the first drawer near my study table. If only I had a way to tell if my cards were there in the drawer (in their usual place)! Well now it looks like I do. I want to make a circut which switches ON when the cards are in their place and OFF otherwise.

#### Desciption:
The circuit will be placed on my table with a part of the circuit going into my drawer. The idea behind this is for me to know if the cards are in their place (in the drawer), which is even the light glows. 

#### Process:
Circuit:
- I connected Arduino to power using the cable provided. 
- I initially set up the circuit using the given switch in Arduino to check the correct working of the circuit.

- Then, I had to remove the switch given in the Arduino kit and attach a small wire. This wire must be a conductor. It is essential for the material to be a conductor for the citcuit to be complete.
    - Understanding the connections of the breadboard, I just needed to connect the parts of the breadboard which are not connected inititally.
    - By removing the swtich, I replaced that with a small piece of wire to test the switch. 
    - This is to make sure that the circuit works as usual.

- I then tested with replacing the small piece of wire with a longer piece of wire. I cut the wire exactly in the middle to make it a switch (which is OFF by default since the wire is cut).

Card (Switch):
- I covered the room card with an aluminium foil. I chose aluminium foil as the material since it is a good conductor and it should act as a switch which when placed on the wires bridges the connection for the circuit and hence, bulb starts flickering.

#### Problems and Solutions:
- The only problem I faced was finding the aluminium foil. I coulnd't find it in the IM Lab as the stock was over. But I finally got my hands on one, thanks to Mr. Niteesh at D2. 

#### Discoveries:
- One of the things that I found was that, I was in search of many conductive materials but I haven't realized how some of them are just around but I do not recognize them. While working with the project, the wire once touched a part of headphone which was aluminium, the circuit was complete and the bulb was flickering. The first place I need to go to look for materials is: well look around myself.
